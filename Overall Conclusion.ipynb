    "Our three metrics were walkability, major crime rates, and environmental pollution. We chose them because together they reflect the overall quality of life in Pittsburgh. Which would be safety, ease of movement (via foot), and the long health of a person in the city. These factors directly shape a resident's day to day living experience, especiially in neighhourhoods where people rely on side walks and public spaces for their means of transport. \n",

    "**Overall Conclusions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our combined results from our three notebooks/analyses, our best neighbourhood would be South/Central Oakland. As it scores very highly in walkability and has relatively low pollution compared to the other densely populated neighbourhoods. In addition to these factors it's crime rate is also incredibly low when measured proportionally with its population size. When considered together, these metrics make South/Central Oakland the most well-rounded and ideal neighbourhood overall from our datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When looking at the data from 1972 please keep in mind that the neighbourhood lines have changed so I estimated the best modern day equivalent neighbourhood while we were comparing. The Walkability and Pollution datasets are relatively new so are not affected by this!"
